# Some algorithms for personal sound zone simulation

This branch focuses on the simulation of some algorithms for personal sound zone. the basic framework of simulation is based on the paper "Maximization of acoustic energy difference between two spaces". Time-domain ACC and frequency-domain ACC are implemented respectively, namely **ACC**, **AED**, **BACC_RD**, **BACC_RTE**.
